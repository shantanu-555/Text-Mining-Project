7338,Michael,There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.,
16761,Dwight,"Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.",
44174,DeAngelo,"That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-",
32563,Michael,Doubt it. [disconnects call],
45846,Jim,Nope. No dog video.,
26729,Jim,"No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!",
38938,Erin,"Oh, who else is going?",
49953,Dwight,"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.",
38144,Darryl,Pam.,

40004,Dwight,"Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!",
52803,Kevin,"Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles.",
17145,Michael,"[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.",
57026,Dwight,It's a divet...,
57516,Pam,"Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.",
18147,Michael,"And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.",
45659,Ryan,"No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.",
34143,Erin,That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.,
50108,Dwight,"[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?",
3191,Ryan,"Okay... uh, sorry?",
26280,Andy,Do you love him?,

5770,Michael,Having fun?,
18727,Dwight,"Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.",

1198,Toby,There's some right there.,
37547,Michael,"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",
51927,Robert,Well you can't say no.,
21016,Michael,Return.,
58299,Jim,Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.,

40242,Lady,Good morning.,
33040,Erin,"He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.",

13544,Michael,Guilty.,
23116,Michael,"Darryl, would you do the honors?",
5792,Dwight,[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?,
21368,Dwight,I got floor.,
28879,Andy,"I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...",

43783,Michael,Ok.,
56139,Jim,"I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?",
57143,Pete,"For a long time, Andy.",
17237,Michael,Shhh...,
